## ‚úèÔ∏è Guidelines

To maintain the quality and consistency of the Law Enforcement MMLU Dataset, please follow these guidelines:

### ‚úÖ Question Writing

- Use clear, concise, and **neutral language** (avoid bias or ambiguity)
- Questions must have **one correct answer** only
- Avoid overly technical jargon unless it is necessary and widely understood in the domain

### üß† Answer Choices (Options)

- Include **four options** per question
- Distractors (incorrect answers) must be **plausible**, not obviously incorrect
- Ensure no two options are **too similar** or **overlapping in meaning**

### üèõ Legal and Domain References

- Cite **publicly available** or officially published legal references (e.g. Penal Code, CPC, Evidence Act, SOPs)
- When referencing internal manuals or enforcement guidelines, ensure they are **non-confidential and accessible**

### üè∑ Metadata Labelling

- **Category**: Choose the appropriate domain (e.g., Cybercrime, Criminal Procedure, AML/CFT)
- **Difficulty**: Label as `Basic`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`
- **Reference**: Specify the act, section, or source (e.g., "Section 117 CPC")
- **Explanation**: Provide a short, factual justification for the correct answer

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using outdated or repealed laws  
- Writing questions that are too opinion-based  
- Reusing the same correct answer too often  
- Including explanations that simply restate the question
